highlighting query part url plot see phishing volume sameen et al efficient ai phishing url detection system table key comparative analysis simple phishing url phishing url based specific lexical feature url consider equal sign reasonably good amount great diversity use lot assignment value id etc however simple phishing url case rarely use equal sign also seen great variation word combination use simple phishing url contrary subtle amount variation word combination ing url opposed hyphen feature great variation word separation phishing url simple phishing url contrast almost variation word

identi cacao accesso weblinks internetbanking login view etc frequently used path term show used fool user access user information hand figure mostly different value used term like id passo plugin default cliente mean attacker tried redirect user page location assigning location position id fragment see simple phishing url consist gibberish combination alphanumeric character give visual

url word cloud communication protocol phishing url similar simple phishing url phishing url also use www service subdomain com sld also tlds given dataset see phishing url used two different subdomains naylorantiques shelldemos path phishing url include word combination like identi cacao naylorantiques com home co doc menu etc hide malicious site deploy malicious code downloading different le user system trick user access credential query part deepphish used combination bogus term like lnms q x agn isch sa origem tbm espv source cta conta etc number plicate query part hence query user unable understand thing correctly easily deceived attacker therefore based exploratory data analysis conclude phishing url usually made feature somehow similar normal url due phishing url
